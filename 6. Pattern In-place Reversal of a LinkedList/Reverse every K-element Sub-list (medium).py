'''
Problem Statement 
Given the head of a LinkedList and a number ‘k’, reverse every ‘k’ sized sub-list starting from the head.

If, in the end, you are left with a sub-list with less than ‘k’ elements, reverse it too.

'''
Time complexity 
The time complexity of our algorithm will be O(N) where ‘N’ is the total number of nodes in the LinkedList.

Space complexity 
We only used constant space, therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm is O(1).
