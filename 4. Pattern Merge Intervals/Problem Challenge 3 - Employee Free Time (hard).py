Problem Challenge 3

Employee Free Time (hard)

For ‘K’ employees, we are given a list of intervals representing the working hours of each employee. 
Our goal is to find out if there is a free interval that is common to all employees. 
You can assume that each list of employee working hours is sorted on the start time.

Example 1:

Input: Employee Working Hours=[[[1,3], [5,6]], [[2,3], [6,8]]]
Output: [3,5]
Explanation: Both the employess are free between [3,5].

Example 2:

Input: Employee Working Hours=[[[1,3], [9,12]], [[2,4]], [[6,8]]]
Output: [4,6], [8,9]
Explanation: All employess are free between [4,6] and [8,9].

Example 3:

Input: Employee Working Hours=[[[1,3]], [[2,4]], [[3,5], [7,9]]]
Output: [5,7]
Explanation: All employess are free between [5,7].

Time complexity 
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N*logK), where ‘N’ is the total number of intervals and ‘K’ is the total number of employees. 
This is due to the fact that we are iterating through the intervals only once (which will take O(N), 
and every time we process an interval, we remove (and can insert) one interval in the Min Heap, (which will take O(logK)O(logK)). 
At any time the heap will not have more than ‘K’ elements.

Space complexity 
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(K) as at any time the heap will not have more than ‘K’ elements.
