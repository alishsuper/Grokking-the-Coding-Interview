Solution Review: Problem Challenge 1 - Minimum Meeting Rooms (hard) 
Given a list of intervals representing the start and end time of ‘N’ meetings, 
find the minimum number of rooms required to hold all the meetings.

Example 1:

Meetings: [[1,4], [2,5], [7,9]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Since [1,4] and [2,5] overlap, we need two rooms to hold these two meetings. [7,9] can 
occur in any of the two rooms later.

Example 2:

Meetings: [[6,7], [2,4], [8,12]]
Output: 1
Explanation: None of the meetings overlap, therefore we only need one room to hold all meetings.

Example 3:

Meetings: [[1,4], [2,3], [3,6]]
Output:2
Explanation: Since [1,4] overlaps with the other two meetings [2,3] and [3,6], we need two rooms to 
hold all the meetings.
 
Example 4:

Meetings: [[4,5], [2,3], [2,4], [3,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: We will need one room for [2,3] and [3,5], and another room for [2,4] and [4,5].
 
Here is a visual representation of Example 4:

'''
Time complexity 
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N*logN), where ‘N’ is the total number of meetings. T
his is due to the sorting that we did in the beginning. 
Also, while iterating the meetings we might need to poll/offer meeting to the priority queue.
Each of these operations can take O(logN). 
Overall our algorithm will take O(NlogN).

Space complexity 
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) which is required for sorting. 
Also, in the worst case scenario, we’ll have to insert all the meetings into the Min Heap (when all meetings overlap) which will also take O(N) space. 
The overall space complexity of our algorithm is O(N).
