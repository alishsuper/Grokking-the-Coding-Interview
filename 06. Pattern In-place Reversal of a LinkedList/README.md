# Pattern 6: In-place Reversal of a LinkedList

In a lot of problems, we are asked to reverse the links between a set of nodes of a <b>LinkedList</b>. Often, the constraint is that we need to do this in-place, i.e., using the existing node objects and without using extra memory.

<b>In-place Reversal of a LinkedList pattern</b> describes an efficient way to solve the above problem.

## Reverse a LinkedList (easy)
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/
> Given the head of a Singly LinkedList, reverse the LinkedList. Write a function to return the new head of the reversed LinkedList.

To reverse a <b>LinkedList</b>, we need to reverse one node at a time. We will start with a variable `curren`t which will initially point to the head of the LinkedList and a variable `previous` which will point to the previous node that we have processed; initially `previous` will point to `null`.

In a stepwise manner, we will reverse the `current` node by pointing it to the `previous` before moving on to the next node. Also, we will update the `previous` to always point to the previous node that we have processed. 

````
class Node {
  constructor(value, next=null) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = next
  }
  
  printList() {
    let result = ""
    let temp = this
    while(temp !== null) {
      result += temp.value + " "
      temp = temp.next
    }
    return result
  }
}

function reverse(head) {
  let current = head
  let previous = null
  
  while(current !== null) {
    //temporarily store the next node
    next = current.next
    
    //reverse the current node
    current.next = previous
    
    //before we move to the next node, 
    //point previous to the current node
    previous = current
    
    //move on to the next node
    current = next
  }
  
  return previous
}

head = new Node(2)
head.next = new Node(4);
head.next.next = new Node(6);
head.next.next.next = new Node(8);
head.next.next.next.next = new Node(10);

console.log(`Nodes of original LinkedList are: ${head.printList()}`)
console.log(`Nodes of reversed LinkedList are: ${reverse(head).printList()}`)
````

- The time complexity of our algorithm will be `O(N)` where `â€˜Nâ€™` is the total number of nodes in the LinkedList.
- We only used constant space, therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm is `O(1)`.

## Reverse a Sub-list (medium)
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/
> Given the head of a LinkedList and two positions `p` and `q`, reverse the LinkedList from position `p` to `q`.

The problem follows the <b>In-place Reversal</b> of a LinkedList pattern. We can use a similar approach as discussed in <b>Reverse a LinkedList</b>. Here are the steps we need to follow:
1. Skip the first `p-1` nodes, to reach the node at position `p`.
2. Remember the node at position `p-1` to be used later to connect with the reversed sub-list.
3. Next, reverse the nodes from `p` to `q` using the same approach discussed in <b>Reverse a LinkedList</b>.
4. Connect the `p-1` and `q+1` nodes to the reversed sub-list.

class Node {
  constructor(value, next = null) {
    this.value = value
    this.next = next
  }
  
  getList() {
    let result = ""
    let temp = this
    while(temp !== null) {
      result += temp.value + " "
      temp = temp.next
    }
    return result
  }
}

function reverseSubList(head, p, q) {
  if(p === q) {
    return head
  }
  
  //after skipping p-1 nodes, current will 
  //point to the p th node
  
  let current = head
  let previous = null
  
  let i = 0
  
  while(current !== null && i < p - 1) {
    previous = current
    current = current.next
    i++
  }
  
  //we are interested in three parts of
  //the LL, the part before index p
  //the part between p and q
  //and the part after index q
  const lastNodeOfFirstPart = previous
  
  //after reversing the LL current will
  //become the last node of the subList
  const lastNodeOfSubList = current
  
  //will be used to temporarily store the next node
  let next = null
  
  i = 0
  //reverse nodes between p and q
  
  while (current !== null && i < q - p + 1) {
    next = current.next
    current.next = previous
    previous = current
    current = next
    i++
  }
  
  //connect with the first part
  if(lastNodeOfFirstPart !== null) {
    //previous is now the first node of the sub list
    lastNodeOfFirstPart.next = previous
    //this means p === 1 i.e., we are changing
    //the first node(head) of the LL
  } else {
    head = previous
  }
  
  //conect with the last part
  lastNodeOfSubList.next = current
  return head
}

head = new Node(1)
head.next = new Node(2);
head.next.next = new Node(3);
head.next.next.next = new Node(4);
head.next.next.next.next = new Node(5);

console.log(`Nodes of original LinkedList are: ${head.getList()}`)
console.log(`Nodes of reversed LinkedList are: ${reverseSubList(head, 2, 4).getList()}`)

- The time complexity of our algorithm will be `O(N)` where `N` is the total number of nodes in the LinkedList.
- We only used constant space, therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm is `O(1)`.

> ðŸŒŸ Reverse the first `k` elements of a given LinkedList.

This problem can be easily converted to our parent problem; to reverse the first `k` nodes of the list, we need to pass `p=1` and `q=k`.

> ðŸŒŸ Given a LinkedList with `n` nodes, reverse it based on its size in the following way:
> 1. If `n` is even, reverse the list in a group of `n/2` nodes.
> 2. If `n` is odd, keep the middle node as it is, reverse the first `n/2` nodes and reverse the last `n/2` nodes.

When `n` is even we can perform the following steps:
1. Reverse first `n/2` nodes: `head = reverse(head, 1, n/2)`
2. Reverse last `n/2` nodes: `head = reverse(head, n/2 + 1, n)`

When `n` is odd, our algorithm will look like:
1. `head = reverse(head, 1, n/2)`
2. `head = reverse(head, n/2 + 2, n)`
Please note the function call in the second step. Weâ€™re skipping two elements as we will be skipping the middle element.

## Reverse every K-element Sub-list (medium)
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/

> Given the head of a LinkedList and a number â€˜kâ€™, <b>reverse every â€˜kâ€™ sized sub-list</b> starting from the head.
> If, in the end, you are left with a sub-list with less than â€˜kâ€™ elements, reverse it too.

The problem follows the <b>In-place Reversal of a LinkedList</b> pattern and is quite similar to <b>Reverse a Sub-list</b>. The only difference is that we have to reverse all the sub-lists. We can use the same approach, starting with the first sub-list (i.e. `p=1, q=k`) and keep reversing all the sublists of size â€˜kâ€™.

    if(current === null) {
      break
    }
    previous = lastNodeOfSubList
  }
  return head
}
