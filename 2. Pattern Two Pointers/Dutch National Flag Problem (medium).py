Problem Statement 
Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. You should treat numbers of the array as objects, 
hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue; 
and since our input array also consists of three different numbers that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.

Example 1:

Input: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
Output: [0 0 1 1 2]

Example 2:

Input: [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
Output: [0 0 1 2 2 2 ]

#mycode
def dutch_flag_sort(arr):
  # TODO: Write your code here
  left, i = 0, 0
  right = len(arr)-1

  while i <= right:
    if arr[i] == 0:
      arr[i], arr[left] = arr[left], arr[i]
      left += 1
      i += 1
    elif arr[i] == 2:
      arr[i], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[i]
      right -= 1 
    else:
      i += 1

  return 





'''
Time complexity 
The time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) as we are iterating the input array only once.

Space complexity #
The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
