# Pattern 12: Bitwise XOR

<b>XOR</b> is a logical bitwise operator that returns `0` (false) if both bits are the same and returns `1` (true) otherwise. In other words, it only returns `1` if exactly one bit is set to `1` out of the two bits in comparison.

|     A    |     B     |  A xor B  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 0|0|0|
| 0|1|1|
| 1|0|1|
| 1|1|0|

It is surprising to know the approaches that the XOR operator enables us to solve certain problems. For example, let‚Äôs take a look at the following problem:

> Given an array of `n-1` integers in the range from `1` to `n`, find the one number that is missing from the array.

A straight forward approach to solve this problem can be:
1. Find the sum of all integers from `1` to `n`; let‚Äôs call it `s1`.
2. Subtract all the numbers in the input array from `s1`; this will give us the missing number.
````
function findMissingNumber(arr) {
  const n = arr.length + 1
  
  //find sum of all numbers from 1 to n
  let s1 = 0
  for(let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    s1 += i
  }
  
  //subtract all numbers in input from sum
  arr.forEach((num) => {
    s1 -= num
  })
  
  //s1, is now the missing number
  return s1
}

findMissingNumber([1,5,2,6,4])//3
````
- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(n)` and the space complexity is `O(1)`.
### What could go wrong with the above algorithm? 
> While finding the sum of numbers from `1` to `n`, we can get integer overflow when `n` is large.

How can we avoid this? Can XOR help us here?

Remember the important property of XOR that it returns 0 if both the bits in comparison are the same. In other words, XOR of a number with itself will always result in 0. This means that if we XOR all the numbers in the input array with all numbers from the range `1` to `n` then each number in the input is going to get zeroed out except the missing number. Following are the set of steps to find the missing number using XOR:
1. XOR all the numbers from `1` to `n`, let‚Äôs call it `x1`.
2. XOR all the numbers in the input array, let‚Äôs call it `x2`.
3. The missing number can be found by `x1` XOR `x2`.
````
function findMissingNumber(arr) {
  const n = arr.length + 1
  
  //x1 represents XOR of all values from 1 to n
  //find sum of all numbers from 1 to n
  let x1 = 1
  for(let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    x1 = x1 ^ i
  }
  
  //x2 represents XOR of all values in arr
  let x2 = arr[0]
  for(let i = 1; i < n-1; i++) {
    x2 = x2 ^ arr[i]
  }
  
  //missing number is the xor of x1 and x2
  return x1 ^ x2
}

findMissingNumber([1,5,2,6,4])//3
````
- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(n)` and the space complexity is `O(1)`. The time and space complexities are the same as that of the previous solution but, in this algorithm, we will not have any integer overflow problem.
### Important properties of XOR to remember 
Following are some important properties of XOR to remember:

- Taking XOR of a number with itself returns 0, e.g.,
  - 1 ^ 1 = 0
  - 29 ^ 29 = 0
- Taking XOR of a number with 0 returns the same number, e.g.,
  - 1 ^ 0 = 1
  - 31 ^ 0 = 31
- XOR is Associative & Commutative, which means:
  - (a ^ b) ^ c = a ^ (b ^ c)
  - a ^ b = b ^ a
## üòï Single Number (easy)
https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/
> In a non-empty array of integers, every number appears twice except for one, find that single number.

One straight forward solution can be to use a <b>HashMap</b> kind of data structure and iterate through the input:
- If number is already present in <b>HashMap</b>, remove it.
- If number is not present in <b>HashMap</b>, add it.
- In the end, only number left in the <b>HashMap</b> is our required single number.
````
function singleNumber(arr) {
  //HashMap
  let numberMap = {}
  //if number is not in HashMap, add it
  for(let i of arr) {
    numberMap[i] = (numberMap[i] || 0) + 1
  }
  //if number is already in HashMap, remove it
  //number left at the end is out rquired single number
  return numberMap
}

findMissingNumber([1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3])//4
findMissingNumber([7, 9, 7])//9
````
Time and space complexity Time Complexity of the above solution will be `O(n)`and space complexity will also be `O(n)`.

Can we do better than this using the <b>XOR</b> Pattern?

Recall the following two properties of XOR:
- It returns zero if we take XOR of two same numbers.
- It returns the same number if we XOR with zero.
So we can XOR all the numbers in the input; duplicate numbers will zero out each other and we will be left with the single number.

````
function singleNumber(arr) {
  //So we can XOR all the numbers in the input; duplicate numbers will zero out each other and we will be left with the single number.
  let num = 0
  
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    //console.log(num, arr[i], num^arr[i], "CL")
    num ^= arr[i]
  }
  return num
}

singleNumber([1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3])//4
singleNumber([7, 9, 7])//9
````
- Time complexity of this solution is `O(n)` as we iterate through all numbers of the input once.
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.
## üòï Two Single Numbers (medium)
https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/

> In a non-empty array of numbers, every number appears exactly twice except two numbers that appear only once. Find the two numbers that appear only once.

This problem is quite similar to <b>Single Number</b>, the only difference is that, in this problem, we have two single numbers instead of one. Can we still use XOR to solve this problem?

Let‚Äôs assume `num1` and `num2` are the two single numbers. If we do XOR of all elements of the given array, we will be left with XOR of `num1` and `num2` as all other numbers will cancel each other because all of them appeared twice. Let‚Äôs call this XOR `n1xn2`. Now that we have XOR of `num1` and `num2`, how can we find these two single numbers?

As we know that `num1` and `num2` are two different numbers, therefore, they should have at least one bit different between them. If a bit in `n1xn2` is ‚Äò1‚Äô, this means that `num1` and `num2` have different bits in that place, as we know that we can get ‚Äò1‚Äô only when we do XOR of two different bits, i.e.,

`
1 XOR 0 = 0 XOR 1 = 1
`

We can take any bit which is ‚Äò1‚Äô in `n1xn2` and partition all numbers in the given array into two groups based on that bit. One group will have all those numbers with that bit set to ‚Äò0‚Äô and the other with the bit set to ‚Äò1‚Äô. This will ensure that `num1` will be in one group and `num2` will be in the other. We can take XOR of all numbers in each group separately to get `num1` and `num2`, as all other numbers in each group will cancel each other. Here are the steps of our algorithm:
1. Taking XOR of all numbers in the given array will give us XOR of `num1` and `num2`, calling this XOR as `n1xn2`.
2. Find any bit which is set in `n1xn2`. We can take the rightmost bit which is ‚Äò1‚Äô. Let‚Äôs call this `rightmostSetBit`.
3. Iterate through all numbers of the input array to partition them into two groups based on `rightmostSetBit`. Take XOR of all numbers in both the groups separately. Both these XORs are our required numbers.

````
function findSingleNumbers(nums) {
  //get the XOR of all the numbers
  let n1xn2 = 0
  nums.forEach((num) => {
    n1xn2 ^= num
  })
  
  //get the rightmost bit that is 1
  let rightmostSetBit = 1
  while((rightmostSetBit & n1xn2) === 0){
    rightmostSetBit = rightmostSetBit << 1
    //The left shift operator ( << ) shifts the first operand the specified number of bits to the left.
    //Excess bits shifted off to the left are discarded. 
    //Zero bits are shifted in from the right.
  }
  let num1 = 0
  let num2 = 0
  
  nums.forEach((num)=> {
    //if the bit is set
    if((num & rightmostSetBit) !== 0) {
      num1 ^= num
    } else {
      //the bit is not set
      num2 ^= num
    }
  })
  return [num1, num2]
}

## üòï Complement of Base 10 Number (medium)
https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/

Every non-negative integer N has a binary representation, for example, 8 can be represented as ‚Äú1000‚Äù in binary and 7 as ‚Äú0111‚Äù in binary.

The complement of a binary representation is the number in binary that we get when we change every 1 to a 0 and every 0 to a 1. For example, the binary complement of ‚Äú1010‚Äù is ‚Äú0101‚Äù.

For a given positive number N in base-10, return the complement of its binary representation as a base-10 integer.

Recall the following properties of XOR:
1. It will return 1 if we take XOR of two different bits i.e. `1^0 = 0^1 = 1`.
2. It will return 0 if we take XOR of two same bits i.e. `0^0 = 1^1 = 0`. In other words, XOR of two same numbers is 0.
3. It returns the same number if we XOR with 0.

From the above-mentioned first property, we can conclude that XOR of a number with its complement will result in a number that has all of its bits set to 1. For example, the binary complement of ‚Äú101‚Äù is ‚Äú010‚Äù; and if we take XOR of these two numbers, we will get a number with all bits set to 1, i.e., `101 ^ 010 = 111`

We can write this fact in the following equation:

`number ^ complement = all_bits_set`

Let‚Äôs add ‚Äònumber‚Äô on both sides:

`number ^ number ^ complement = number ^ all_bits_set`

From the above-mentioned second property:

`0 ^ complement = number ^ all_bits_set`

From the above-mentioned third property:

`complement = number ^ all_bits_set`

We can use the above fact to find the complement of any number.

<b>How do we calculate `all_bits_set`?</b> One way to calculate `all_bits_set` will be to first count the bits required to store the given number. We can then use the fact that for a number which is a complete power of ‚Äò2‚Äô i.e., it can be written as pow(2, n), if we subtract ‚Äò1‚Äô from such a number, we get a number which has ‚Äòn‚Äô least significant bits set to ‚Äò1‚Äô. For example, ‚Äò4‚Äô which is a complete power of ‚Äò2‚Äô, and ‚Äò3‚Äô (which is one less than 4) has a binary representation of ‚Äò11‚Äô i.e., it has ‚Äò2‚Äô least significant bits set to ‚Äò1‚Äô.

````
function calculateBitwiseComplement(num) {
  //count number of total bits in num
  let bitCount = 0
  let n = num
  while(n > 0) {
    bitCount ++
    n = n >> 1
    //The right shift operator ( >> ) shifts the first operand the specified number of bits to the right. 
    //Excess bits shifted off to the right are discarded.
  }
  
  //for a number which is a complete power of two, 
  //i.e., it can be wrtiten as pow(1, n),
  //if we subtract 1 from such a number, we get a number
  //which has n least significant bits set to 1
  //For example, 4 which is a complete power of 2, 
  //and 3 (which is one less than 4) ahs a binary
  //representation of 11 i.e., it has 2 least significant bits set to 1
  let allBitsSet = Math.pow(2, bitCount) -1
  
  //from the solution description: complement = number ^ allBitsSet
  return num ^ allBitsSet
}

calculateBitwiseComplement(8)//7, 8 is 1000 in binary, its complement is 0111 in binary, which is 7 in base-10.
calculateBitwiseComplement(10)//5, 10 is 1010 in binary, its complement is 0101 in binary, which is 5 in base-10.
